OpenWRT administration HTTP api written in go  (Golang MIPS/ARM/x86 cross compilation)
----

This project was created to be used for a mobile APP to display system info and network status. OpenWRT configuartion changes and other features could also be implemented with little effort.

* Golang net/http and [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) is used for HTTP API
* HTTP API uses JSON data to comunicate with ubus [(OpenWrt micro bus architecture)](https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/ubus)
